            <h2>Hey, I'm Raheem Wilson</h2>
            <p>A humble young adult who currently resides in Trelawny. 
                I am currently in my second year pursuing a Computer Science degree at the UWI. I 
                enjoy coding as it helps me to realize my problem solving skills and create fun as well as 
                meaningful software applications. This has driven me to delve into the numerous aspects of Computer Science
                and so, I have chosen to concentrate on Web Development. I have had informal experiences with Web Development and
                have grown to love this aspect of computer science.
